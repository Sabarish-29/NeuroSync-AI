## Slide 2: The Problem
```
Title: The Online Learning Crisis

90% Dropout Rate
- One-size-fits-all approach
- No real-time adaptation
- Students struggle silently
- Teachers can't scale personalization

## Slide 3: Our Solution
```
Title: NeuroSync - 22 Learning Moments

Real-time detection of:
- Attention drops (M01)
- Cognitive overload (M02)
- Knowledge gaps (M03)
- Frustration (M07)
- Fatigue (M10)
... and 17 more

[Graphic: Circle with 22 points, highlight 5 main ones]

Every 250ms -> Detect -> Adapt -> Intervene
```

## Slide 4: How It Works
```
Title: Multimodal Signal Fusion

[Diagram with 5 input sources converging to fusion engine]

Inputs:
- Webcam (attention, expression)
- Behavioral (clicks, rewinds, pauses)
- NLP (text analysis)
- Knowledge Graph (concept mastery)
- Timing (fatigue, circadian rhythm)

## Slide 7: Innovation Highlights
```
Title: What Makes NeuroSync Unique

22 Learning Moments
   vs typical 3-5 "stuck states"

Real-Time Multimodal Fusion
   Not just quiz results

Personalized Forgetting Curves
   Spaced repetition adapted per student

Knowledge Graph Prerequisites
   Neo4j tracks concept dependencies

100% Free to Operate
   Groq + gTTS + local Neo4j = $0

Production Ready
   400+ tests, comprehensive docs
```

## Slide 9: Impact Potential
```
Title: Expected Outcomes

Based on Learning Science Literature:

Dropout Rate: 90% -> 30% (target)
Retention: +23% improvement
Time-to-Mastery: -18% reduction
Student Confidence: +35% increase

## Slide 10: Business Model
```
Title: Go-to-Market Strategy

Target: K-12 Schools, Coaching Institutes

Pricing:
  Free: First 5 students
  School: Rs.50/student/month
  Enterprise: Custom pricing

Example ROI:
School with 500 students:
- Revenue: Rs.25,000/month
- Cost: Rs.10,000/month (hosting, support)
- Margin: 60%

Break-even: 200 students (~4 schools)
```

---

## Slide 11: Roadmap
```
Title: Next Steps

Phase 1:
- IRB approval for student trials
- 100-student pilot program
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)

Phase 2:
- Multi-language support (Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
- EEG hardware integration
- Cloud deployment (AWS)

Phase 3:
- 10,000 students across 50 schools
- Research paper publication
- Patent filing
```
